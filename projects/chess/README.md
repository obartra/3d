# The Differently-abled Chess Set

This project is a tribute to our dog trainer, Casey Buckley who runs [WP Creative Pets](https://www.wpcreativepets.com/). If you have a dog, particularly a reactive dog, and are in the Philadelphia area, you won't find a better trainer. She readily adapts to different teaching styles, is trauma informed, queer friendly, and extremely talented.

Our doggo, Iroh, had a some anxiety issues that we weren't able to overcome until we contacted her. Here he is now, being a good boy:

As a thank you for her tireless work, I wanted to build a 3d project that doubled as practice for myself, as I'm learning 3D printing, and honored her work. I know she collects unique chess sets so the project seemed like a good fit.

I found [this chess set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5590380) in Thingiverse that was adorable and seemed like a good starting point.
