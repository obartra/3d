This project is a tribute to my dog trainer, Casey Buckley, who runs [WP Creative Pets](https://www.wpcreativepets.com/). If you have a dog, especially a reactive one, and are in the Philadelphia area, you won't find a better trainer. She readily adapts to different teaching styles, is trauma-informed, queer-friendly, and extremely talented.

## Background

Our dog, Iroh, had some anxiety issues that we couldn't overcome until we contacted her. Here he is now, being a good boy:

<p align="center">
    <img alt="Black and white pitbull husky mix dog with a blue collar and tags sitting on a path covered in pink flower petals, with trees and greenery lining the path in the background on a sunny day." src="./images/Iroh.png" width="200" />
</p>

As a thank you for Casey's tireless work and her impact on Iroh, I wanted to make a 3D project that served both as practice for myself, as I'm learning 3D printing, and to honored her work. Knowing she collects unique chess sets, I decided to build her a custom chess set featuring dogs with disabilities. It was important that these were displayed with normalcy and focusing on the positive rather than any limiting aspects since that would more accurately capture her focus and her work.

## Chess Pieces

I found [this chess set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5590380) on Thingiverse that was both adorable and a great starting point.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="Six white 3D-printed chess pieces resembling dogs, including two with crowns, and a small doghouse, all placed on a green surface. This image shows the original chess set design that inspired the differently-abled dog chess set." src="./images/reference-set.png" width="400" />
</p>

### 3D Model Ideation and Design

The idea was to create a set that not only represents different dog breeds but also highlights various disabilities in a positive and inclusive manner. I wanted to highlight a diverse range of disabilities to make the set as inclusive and representative as possible. These disabilities were chosen to reflect both visible and invisible conditions, temporary and permanent ones, aiming to bring awareness through chess.

| Chess Piece | Disability | Adaptive Aid |
| - | - | - |
| King | Front leg amputee | Prosthetic leg |
| Queen | Temporary disability (Post-Surgery) | Cone |
| Bishop | Paralysis | Wheelchair |
| Knight | Blindness | Halo |
| Rook | Arthritis | Ramp, Orthopedic mat |
| Pawns 1 & 2 | Swallowing disorder | Feeding bottle |
| Pawns 3 & 4 | Invisible disability | N/A |
| Pawns 5 & 6 | Anxiety disorder | Medication |
| Pawns 7 & 8 | Degenerative disc disease | Orthopedic bed |

The next step was to figure out how to represent these disabilities in the models. I incorporated some additional designs from Thingiverse into the project and created the rest.

For instance, the bishop's wheelchair was based on [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1397964):

![Small Chihuahua in a 3D-printed neon green and black wheelchair, barking or howling, against a bright yellow background.](./images/figowebp.webp)

The final rendering looked like this:

![Row of black 3D-rendered chess pieces resembling differently-abled dogs on round bases, placed on a bright green background. From left to right: a dog with a prosthetic leg and crown, a dog with a cone and crown, a dog in a wheelchair, a dog with a halo, a dog in a doghouse with an accessible ramp, and five small dogs in various poses, one with a feeding bottle, one with pills, one sitting on an orthopedic bed. These pieces represent the custom differently-abled dog chess set](./images/render/all.png)

### 3D Printing Process

To achieve the best results, I used a small layer height of 0.12mm to capture small details. The pieces are printed solid, making them heavier and more durable.

It took a couple of iterations to figure out how to best print them; some, like the king and the bishop, printed better without supports. Others, like the queen (for the cone) and the knight (for the halo), needed them.

Since many had delicate details (like the knight's halo), I decided to coat them in transparent UV resin to increase their strength.

### Using UV Resin

Using UV resin strengthens the pieces but requires safety precautions such as wearing protective gear. The process is straightforward but requires some preparation. Follow the resin’s instructions for curing time to avoid overcuring. Ensure you never look directly into the UV light and avoid skin contact with the resin.

| Material | Image |
| - | - |
| [UV resin](https://a.co/d/ezitsoy) | <img src="./images/materials/resin.jpg" width="200" /> |
| [UV light](https://a.co/d/ezitsoy) | <img src="./images/materials/uvlight.webp" width="200" /> |

| [Protective Coat](https://a.co/d/4McWedg) | <img src="./images/materials/coat.webp" height="200" /> |

After the resin was applied, and to make sure the pieces glided through the chessboard nicely, I used [green felt](https://a.co/d/2bVIOpZ).

### Final Chess Pieces

Here is the final result:

## Cards

The goal of the cards was to make the disabilities displayed in the chess pieces more clear while highlighting them in a positive or neutral way, not as a limitation but simply part of the dog's life. 

After exploring different styles, I chose an ornate, antique look.

| Antique | Eco-Friendly | Modern |
| - | - | - |
| ![Ornate, antique, floral style prototype version of Kingly the Great Dane card](./images/card/style-antique.jpg) | ![Eco-friendly, modern style prototype version of Kingly the Great Dane card](./images/card/style-eco.jpg) | ![Minimalistic style prototype version of Kingly the Great Dane card](./images/card/style-minimal.jpg) |

Since WP Creative Pets' motto is "Every Moment is a Training Moment," I wanted to incorporate it as part of the card set. With some more ChatGPT help, I got to the approximate Latin translation of "Omne Momentum Disciplina Est."

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/card/moto.png" width="200" alt="Ornate vintage-style illustration featuring a decorative floral frame with a circular empty center and banners reading 'Omne Momentum' at the top and 'Disciplina Est' at the bottom, in shades of brown and beige" />
</p>

### Fonts and Design

Font-wise, I chose Trajan Pro for both the motto and the title since it seemed to pair well with the card style. OpenDyslexicAlta for the body was chosen for legibility and accessibility, particularly since the whole point of this exercise is to not be limited by disabilities.

They printed on high-quality plastic and cut and shipped the cards.

An older iteration of the cards is also available [here](./assets/us_game_deck.psd), but I decided against it due to their smaller size, which impacted readability, and ultimately, I wasn't happy with my first design. If you are curious about it, this is how they looked:

## Board

The chessboard is designed to represent a dog park, with half the tiles representing "sand" and the other half "grass," surrounded by a road.

### Board Design and Construction

The chessboard represents a dog park with grass and sand tiles, surrounded by a road. The tiles were printed with detailed textures to mimic real-life surfaces. The chessboard is composed of four quadrants, each repeated twice:

![Diagram of a chessboard divided into four quadrants, each with a distinct pattern. The board shows that the diagonals from the bottom-left to the top-right and from the bottom-right to the top-left have consistent patterns. The quadrants are marked with different colors and hatching styles, with clear delineation to demonstrate the division and pattern consistency along the diagonals.](./images/chess-diagonals.png)

Representing the grass required several iterations, finally landing on this pattern that printed as a small series of thin, hair-like strands. The holes were filled with the sand tiles, which were printed vertically for better resolution.

![3D printer creating the green tiles representing 'grass' for a dog park-themed chessboard. The nozzle moves back and forth, depositing green filament layer by layer. The tile gradually takes shape with a detailed texture, contrasting with the surroundings.](./images/board/grass-printing.gif)

![Close-up of a green 'grass' quadrant for the dog park-themed chessboard, featuring a textured surface. A white 'sand' tile is placed in one of the spaces, contrasting with the green 'grass' tiles surrounding it. The 'sand' tile has a smooth, wavy texture, highlighting the difference between the two tile types.](./images/board/first-sand-tile.jpeg)

Once the four grass quadrants were printed and filled with the sand tiles, I glued them in place on top of a metal sheet to give them a weighted feel. I used 6061 Aluminum alloy from <https://www.onlinemetals.com>, which offers custom cuts, allowing me to order a pre-cut sheet.

![Pre-assembled dog park-themed chessboard with alternating green 'grass' and white 'sand' tiles. The textured green tiles contrast with the smooth, wavy white tiles, creating a checkerboard pattern. Some tiles are stacked in the background, and the board is partially assembled on a work surface, showing the progress of the project.](./images/board/pre-assembled.jpeg)

For the border, I used [these tiles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2480607) from Thingiverse that already looked like pavement and added different scenes with dogs relaxing, playing, and trying to grab some bones and fruit.

![A 3D rendering of a rectangular tile with a cobblestone texture. The tile is blue and laid flat on a gray grid, showcasing its detailed, uneven surface, resembling a section of a cobblestone path.](./images/board/pavement.webp)

The scene adds a playful and realistic touch to the edge of the board.](./images/board/side-hydrant.jpeg) |

I tried to cover the gaps between the quadrants using a 3D pen and sanding the excess, but they were still fairly visible.

Finally, I covered the surface using UV resin again. I wish I had taken into account the gaps because they caused some large bubbles. The heated resin also dissolved the grass threads, which was unfortunate. You can see how it looked with and without resin below:

| With Resin | Without Resin |

The resin adds a glossy finish, making the colors and details more vibrant.](./images/board/full.jpeg) | ![Partially assembled dog park-themed chessboard on a wooden table.

Tools and supplies, including tape and spray paint, are scattered around the table. Two chess pieces, a knight and a rook, are placed on the board, but UV resin has not been applied.](./images/board/assembled.jpeg) |

## Board Box

I couldn't use the 3D printer for the box since it was much larger than the chessboard. Making it a single solid piece ensures it can reliably hold the chessboard.

Since the chessboard is 13.75"x13.75", I repurposed a 14" pizza box. I painted it purple and stenciled a chess piece with a dog head as a logo. For protection, I added a clear [polycrylic](https://a.co/d/cTNn0YK) coat. You can see the process below:

| Spray Paint | <img alt="Stencil design being spray-painted onto a surface, taped down with blue painter's tape. The design, a chess knight piece with a dog's head, is being sprayed black.

The background includes some flowers in a vase, suggesting the box is in a kitchen or living area." src="./images/box/stencil-repainted.jpeg" width="200" /> |

For the inside, I wanted to add a Braille sign since we have a blind dog in the chess set. The text includes a link to this post. I used <https://touchsee.me> to generate the STL files for contracted (Grade 2) Braille so the text reads:

| Plain Text | Contracted | Braille | Render | Assembled |

The chessboard is visible on the top, featuring green and beige squares with a gray border. Inside the top fold of the box, there is a purple and black Braille text." /> |

It took several attempts to achieve clear Braille text. There's also a QR code that links to this page. I generated it using <https://printer.tools/qrcode2stl>. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to print it in a way that looked good enough to include in the board. Ultimately, I made an additional card with the QR code instead.

| Render | Result | Card |
| - | - | - |
| ![A 3D render of a QR code with an information icon in the center and a square border around the entire code.

The print has significant stringing issues, with thin strands of filament connecting various parts of the QR code. The code is printed in black on a purple background, with the text "bit.ly/dogchess" at the bottom. The information icon is visible in the center of the code, and the print is bordered by a square frame. The surface of the print is uneven and messy due to the stringing.](./images/qr/attempt.png) | ![A card with an ornate, floral frame around a QR code. The card contains the following text: 'obarta.github.io/3d/projects/chess Made with ❤️ by Oscar Bartra for Casey Buckley, WP Creative Pets, and all her pets'](./images/card/print-qr.png) |

For both the Braille and QR code, I had to add a pause to change the filament since my printer doesn't support multi-material prints. To do this, add `M600` to the generated G-code where the pause should happen. If you are curious what happens when you add the pause at the wrong layer, you can see it here:

![A photograph of a failed 3D print of a braille board on a wooden surface. The print has a black top layer with visible braille dots, but the color change was applied incorrectly, resulting in the black filament being used on the last layer of the base part instead of the intended layer. The board is bordered by a purple frame, and the surface appears uneven and messy due to the filament color issue. The braille text is difficult to read because of the incorrect layer color change.](./images/braille/attempt-layer.png)

Lastly, I used the same felt as for the chess pieces to cover the bottom of the inside of the box.

## Pieces Holder

To keep the pieces organized and protected, I designed a custom box. It's a bit bulky but I wanted the holder inside to double as a stand for the pieces so they can be more easily displayed. The box is a square cube with an insert inside meant to help minimize the piece movement. The front of the box has a lid that slides in and has the same dog chess piece image that we stenciled in for the board box.
